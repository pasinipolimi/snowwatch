MISSION2=Mission
MISSION_LNG=Our mission is to provide you a unique service for your mountain experience while helping the environment. We developed an artificial intelligence algorithm that is able to discover photograph depicting Alpine mountains and enrich them with information about the position orientation of the photographer, mountain peaks and snow covered areas, while using this information to help several Environmental Protectino Agencies to keep our mountains and glaciers monitored. Feel free to upload your own photograph and look how it is transformed in a small virtual snow measurement station. Document and share with your friends your Alpine adventures.
PROJECT=The project
PROJECT_LNG=The project SnowWatch is conducted by "Web, Data and Society" research group at Politecnico di Milano. We use the newest algorithms in Data Mining, Machine Learning and Computer Vision to provide you with the best entertaining experience. SnowWatch is funded by POR-FESR 2007-2013 PROACTIVE Project, http://www.proactiveproject.eu

CHEST=CHEST
CHEST_LNG=CHEST -Collective enHanced Environment for Social Tasks- is a 30 month Research and Development project supported under the Seventh Framework Programme to promote the development of digital based innovations that have the potential to address key societal challenges. In addition to the development of an online community platform that will facilitate the sharing and exchanging of ideas, the CHEST project has invested up to â‚¬2.5 million in seed finance for highly innovative digital based technologies, concepts and systems that address a specific societal challenge. Our organisation -Politecnico di Milano- has been successful in receiving support through the scheme for the MountainWatch.
